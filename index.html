    <h1 class="text-center">How do Large U.S. Cities Compare on Violent Crime?</h1>
    
    <p>Crime in America has plummeted since its numerical peak in 1992; the violent sort by 38%, according to FBI statistics. To what extent can innovations in policing like Compstat explain the decline? Naturally, police departments and politicians take much of the credit. In July Charlie Beck, chief of the LAPD, said that new crime figures showed Los Angeles to be the “safest big city” in the country (though only three other cities matched his definition of “big”: New York, Chicago and Houston). The mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa, boasts that the city is safer than at any time since 1952. Both agree that the police have been doing a fine job.

Driving one evening through Watts, a poor part of South Los Angeles with a troubled past, Sergeant Steve Lurie explains that his colleagues find they are called on to be social workers, child psychologists and marriage-guidance counsellors as often as they are police officers. He knows the projects, the gangs and the problems. He describes the challenges of “hood days”: on dates that correspond to numbered streets (eg, October 3rd for 103rd Street), the gang within whose territory the street falls holds a big party. Often this means nothing more than food, drink and music. But sometimes the gangbangers take the opportunity to go on a murderous shooting spree on neighbouring turf.  </p>

         <h1 class="text-center">Cities Vary in How Violent Crime is Trending</h1>    
            
                <p><span><strong><span class="firstLetter">O</span></strong></span> ther analysts look to structural or demographic explanations. Jack Levin, a criminology professor at Northeastern University in Boston, acknowledges the success of policing strategies, but notes that an ageing society like the United States should expect to experience less violent crime. Immigration also matters, he says: studies have repeatedly shown that cities with large immigrant populations experience lower rates of violent crime.

Then there is the awkward issue of incarceration. America continues to lock up a scandalously large number of its people: around 1% of the adult population is behind bars at any time. But, says Mr Levin, “the relationship between the incarceration rate and the violent-crime rate is not very strong.” New York has not followed the national mania for imprisonment, and yet the decline in its crime has been among the most impressive. Indeed, in states with a particular fondness for imprisoning citizens, such as California, the policy may have done more harm than good. Jonathan Simon, a law professor at Berkeley, points out that removing young men from their communities for long stretches erodes the social links—an older relative, say—that might otherwise help prod them out of crime. Today, under a controversial policy known as “realignment” forced on California by the Supreme Court, the crowds of inmates in the state’s prisons have at last begun to thin out. </p>

        <h1 class="text-center">Detroit Stands Out Above the Rest</h1> 
        <p><span><strong><span class="firstLetter">A</span></strong></span>n emerging challenge for police in some cities is that tactics that prove effective in the short term may also lose them trust. Their widely used “stop-and frisk” powers in New York City, for example, may have taken thousands of guns off the street, but they have also led to furious allegations of racial profiling. “We’ve figured out that encounters with young people reduce violence, but they also have negative effects,” says Mr Simon. “Let’s see if we can separate the two.” A growing number of police are being killed on duty.

Moreover, the good news hardly extends to every corner of the country. Violent crime remains extremely high in some troubled cities, such as Memphis and Detroit, and in smaller places such as Oakland, California, and Camden, New Jersey. Most striking is an unexpected spike of gang-related violence in Chicago, where murders are up by 28% so far this year. Against a backdrop of a long-term decline in all crime in the city, as well as a 10% decline for the year, the sudden unrest has caused some alarm.

The real challenge will come when crime rates bottom out nationally, as one day they will. Compstat may have given some police officers sleepless nights, but in a broad environment of falling crime there is more credit than blame to go around. When the crime rate starts to rise, Compstat meetings will become that much harsher. </p>

Last year there were 234 homicides in the city, which has a population of 650,000. It was a 20-year-low, but still meant that one in every 2,700 people was murdered. In Britain, that figure is about one in 85,000.</p>
